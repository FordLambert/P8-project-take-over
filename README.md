-> This is a work in progress

This is the eighth project of my path with OpenClassroom.

As the final project, the goal here is to work on an already existing code.
I am given a non-functionnal app and I must debug it, analyse it and enchance it.

The app is a ToDo list organiser, at first with bugs and not a lot of options.
